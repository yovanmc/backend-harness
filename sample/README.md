# OrdersApi — Backend Harness Validation Fixture

## Purpose

This is the end-to-end validation fixture for the [`backend-harness`](../) Claude Code plugin: a small, real **brownfield .NET 10 Orders API** used to demonstrate the harness against real tooling — xUnit for tests and [Stryker.NET](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/introduction/) for mutation testing.

It is deliberately seeded so that running `/harness-implement` against it makes the harness's two core quality gates **visibly fire**: the functional fix loop and the tiered mutation gate.

## The two seeded conditions

**1. Functional fix-loop seed (`OrderService`)**

`OrderService.CalculateTotal` contains a real bug: it *adds* the discount instead of subtracting it (`subtotal + discount` rather than `subtotal - discount`). The unit test `OrderServiceTests.Total_AppliesDiscount` is committed **RED** (expects 90 for a 100 subtotal at 10% off; the bug returns 110).

When the harness runs its full unit evaluation, the Backend Evaluator catches this failing test and dispatches the Fix Agent for the `OrderService` component.

**2. Mutation-gate seed (`PaymentService`)**

`PaymentService` ships with **happy-path-only tests**. `PaymentService.Charge` has three branches (non-positive amount, amount exceeding order total, success) but only the success path is exercised. Stryker's surviving mutants on the untested guard branches push the kill-rate **below the `services` tier threshold (70%)**.

When the demo feature modifies `PaymentService.cs`, the harness's mutation gate evaluates the changed file, finds the kill-rate below 70%, and trips — driving a fix iteration that adds the missing edge-case tests.

## Prerequisites

- `~/.dotnet/dotnet` — .NET SDK 10
- Stryker.NET: `~/.dotnet/dotnet tool install -g dotnet-stryker`
- The [`backend-harness`](../) plugin installed (see the root README)
- The `superpowers` plugin installed (the harness's inner loop depends on it)

## Verifying the seeds (deterministic, no harness)

You can confirm the seeds are real before involving the harness. Run from `sample/OrdersApi`:

```bash
# Functional seed: exactly one RED unit test
~/.dotnet/dotnet test --filter Category=Unit
# Expected: 3 passed, 1 failed — the failure is OrderServiceTests.Total_AppliesDiscount

# Integration tests are green
~/.dotnet/dotnet test --filter Category=Integration
# Expected: all pass

# Mutation seed: PaymentService.cs below the 70% services threshold
# (Stryker needs a green baseline — see "Confirming the mutation seed" below)
~/.dotnet/dotnet stryker
# Expected: report shows PaymentService.cs mutation score < 70%

# API smoke check
./scripts/api-smoke.sh
# Expected: api-smoke PASS: GET /orders/1/total -> 200, body=50
```

> **Confirming the mutation seed in isolation:** Stryker requires a passing test baseline to determine which mutants are killed, but the functional seed keeps the unit suite RED. To measure the mutation seed cleanly, temporarily apply the discount fix, run Stryker, then restore the seeded bug:
> ```bash
> sed -i.bak 's/return subtotal + discount;/return subtotal - discount;/' src/OrdersApi/Services/OrderService.cs
> ~/.dotnet/dotnet test --filter Category=Unit   # now all green
> ~/.dotnet/dotnet stryker                        # PaymentService.cs < 70%
> mv src/OrdersApi/Services/OrderService.cs.bak src/OrdersApi/Services/OrderService.cs
> ~/.dotnet/dotnet test --filter Category=Unit   # RED again — seed restored
> ```

## Running the end-to-end demonstration

1. Open a Claude Code session with the working directory set to `sample/OrdersApi`.
2. Run `/harness-implement`. The demo plan at `plans/2026-05-31-add-refunds-plan.md` (add refund support) is already present, so the harness goes straight into its outer loop.
3. Watch the harness generate a Context Brief (this is a brownfield repo), implement the refund feature via the inner loop (superpowers `subagent-driven-development`), then run the full evaluation.

## Expected convergence trace

A human observing the run should see, in order:

1. **Context Brief generated** (`plans/context-brief.md`) — the repo is non-trivial/brownfield.
2. **Inner loop implements** `Refund` + the `POST /orders/{id}/refund` endpoint and commits.
3. **First full evaluation fails** — `OrderServiceTests.Total_AppliesDiscount` is RED → `OrderService` flagged as a failing component.
4. **Fix Agent fixes the discount bug** (`subtotal - discount`); `iterations[OrderService]` becomes 1.
5. **Component-scoped re-eval of `OrderService` passes**; per the force-full rule, the next evaluation is full.
6. **Full regression eval passes** — all functional tests green.
7. **Mutation gate runs** on the changed `PaymentService.cs`; kill-rate is below 70% → **gate trips**; `iterations[PaymentService]` becomes 1.
8. **Fix Agent adds edge-case tests** for the untested guard branches; the mutation gate re-runs and **passes** (≥ 70%).
9. **`plans/harness-state.json` reaches `"phase": "done"`**; `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` runs.

## Success criteria

The run is a success when **both gates demonstrably fired** — one functional fix on `OrderService`, one mutation-driven fix on `PaymentService` — and the final state is `phase=done` with no escalation.

Exact iteration counts depend on live subagent behavior; the acceptance bar is *the gates firing and convergence to `done`*, not a byte-exact state match.

## Troubleshooting: Stryker can't find .NET

Stryker.NET ships as a `net8.0` tool and shells out to a bare `dotnet`. If your SDK is installed in a non-standard location (e.g. `~/.dotnet` rather than `/usr/local/share/dotnet`), `dotnet stryker` may fail with *"You must install .NET to run this application"* or *"start process 'dotnet' ... No such file or directory"*. Fix it by pointing Stryker at the SDK and putting `dotnet` on `PATH`:

```bash
export DOTNET_ROOT="$HOME/.dotnet"
export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet:$HOME/.dotnet/tools:$PATH"
```

This is only needed for non-standard SDK locations; a default install resolves automatically.

## Note on determinism

This is a live, human-observed run, and subagent fix quality varies. If the harness escalates instead (e.g. oscillation detection or the 3-iteration cap), that is **also a valid observation** — it demonstrates the harness's safety behavior. Review `plans/harness-state.json` to see what happened and why.
